Fact:
The fact table mainly consists of business facts, measurements of a business process and foreign keys 
that refer to primary keys in the dimension tables. It holds the data we want to analyze.
For example, revenue generated in a software testing company is a fact and this data is 
stored in fact table.

Dimension:
A dimension table stores the attributes to narrate the objects in a fact table. 
It holds the necessary information to query the data from the facts table.
For example, user may want to fetch the revenue generated of the company for a 
particular time period so "Date" is a common dimension here.

Staging Area:
DWH Staging area is the location where the data from source system is 
temporarily copied. Staging area is required since the source systems are available 
for a specific time period to extract data.
